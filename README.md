# Summerproject_2022

Dear Sir, Dear Madam,

I am in my 4th year of engineering school at Polytech in Montpellier, France and this summer I did an internship at the University of Mälardalen located in Västeras, Sweden.

This internship lasted about 3 months and you can see in this file the summary of it.

I advise you to read my internship report before starting to be interested in the code written in C++ on the Qt framework. If you want to test it, don't forget to download the file "new_small_test" which will allow you to have the files to compare.

I wish you a good day.
